### Introduction
System design interviews are a crucial part of the technical interview process, especially for senior roles. This repository focuses on the unique challenges and considerations of designing systems for mobile applications.

Why System Design for Mobile?
Mobile applications come with their own set of constraints and opportunities, such as:

Limited resources (CPU, memory, battery)
Network variability
Different form factors and screen sizes
Offline capabilities
Platform-specific guidelines (iOS and Android)
Understanding these factors is key to designing efficient, scalable, and user-friendly mobile applications.
